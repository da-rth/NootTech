#  NootTech frontend

A bunch of quick, technical notes.

## How to run

1. `node install`
2. In another terminal, run django server
3. `node run dev`

TODO: make a small startup script.

## Naming convention

- Every component defined in this project shall have a meaningful lowercase name starting with
`nt-` (kebab convention, or `Nt` under the traditional CamelCase convention).
The filename should be capitalised and end with `.vue`.
